# Deploy Application with PostgreSQL Installed by Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)

This guide walks you through a workflow that creates and deploys an application along with its required components. Below is a breakdown of the process:

1. **Application and GitOps Repositories Creation**:  
   Using Backstage software templates, the workflow creates:
   - A GitHub repository containing the application source code and CI configuration using GitHub actions.
   - A GitOps repository for managing the deployment workflow.

2. **Monitoring GitHub Action Completion**:  
   The workflow ensures the application is successfully built, and its container image is pushed to the image registry.

3. **PostgreSQL Deployment**:  
   The workflow uses AAP to deploy a PostgreSQL instance on an OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster for the application.

4. **Application Deployment**:  
   The workflow deploys the application on the OCP cluster using Red Hat OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD).

## Requirements

1. **OCP Cluster**
2. **RHDH Configuration**:  
   - Orchestrator plugins version >= 1.3.  
   - GitHub provider.  
   - ArgoCD plugin.  
   - PetClinic software template imported from [spring-petclinic-software-template folder](./spring-petclinic-software-template).

3. **OpenShift GitOps/ArgoCD**
   - see [how we do it](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-go-operator/tree/main/docs/gitops#install-openshift-gitops-operator-1)
5. **Image Registry**:  
   - Quay.io (default) with a target repository created.
6. **AAP** with [Ansible playbook](./postgres_playbook/psql.yaml) imported (details below)
7. **A GitHub organization** (not a personal GitHub account) is required, as the software template automates the creation of new repositories within that organization.
8. **GitHub Token** at organization level: To enable the software template automation to create and configure repositories, your GitHub organization must define an organization-level secret named `REPO_TOKEN`.
  This token should be a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the following minimum permissions:

  | Scope              | Permission           | Reason                                                                 |
  |-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `repo`            | Full access          | Required to create branches, commit files, and open pull requests in new repositories |
  | `workflow`        | `write` *(optional)* | Needed if the automation triggers GitHub Actions workflows in the created repositories |
  | `admin:repo_hook` | `read` or `write` *(optional)* | Required if webhooks are configured automatically for CI/CD or integrations |
  
  > ðŸ“Œ The `REPO_TOKEN` must be added as an **organization-level secret** under:  
  > `GitHub â†’ Organization Settings â†’ Actions â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions secrets`
  
  For guidance on creating a GitHub PAT, refer to [GitHub Docs: Creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Installation
To install the workflow, apply the Kubernetes manifests located in the [`manifests`](./aap-db-deploy-workflow/manifests/) directory.  
These manifests are ordered numerically to reflect their intended deployment sequence.

> **Note**: Before deploying, ensure the following prerequisites are satisfied:
> - The PostgreSQL secret references are correctly configured in the [SonataFlow Custom Resource](./aap-db-deploy-workflow/manifests/04-sonataflow_aap-db-deploy.yaml).
> - All required secrets are defined in the [Kubernetes Secret resource](./aap-db-deploy-workflow/manifests/00-secret_aap-db-deploy-secrets.yaml).

### Deploy the Workflow
```bash
oc apply -n sonataflow-infra -f ./aap-db-deploy-workflow/manifests
```

### Verify the Deployment
To confirm the workflow was deployed successfully, run:
```bash
oc get sonataflow -n sonataflow-infra aap-db-deploy
```

Expected output:
```
NAME            PROFILE   VERSION   URL   READY   REASON
aap-db-deploy   gitops    1.0             True
```

## Building the workflow and installing from built resources
Sometimes a workflow may need to be modifiedâ€”for example, to fix a bug or introduce new functionality. In such cases, it must be rebuilt.
To build the workflow image and push it to the image registry, use the [./scripts/build.sh](../scripts/build.sh) script:
```bash
../scripts/build.sh --help
```

Provide the desired values to the env variables and run the following command from the current directory, e.g.:

1. Build the image and generate the manifests:
```bash
WORKFLOW_IMAGE=<image:tag> # e.g. quay.io/orchestrator/demo-aap-db-deploy:latest
../scripts/build.sh --image=$WORKFLOW_IMAGE -w aap-db-deploy-workflow
```

The manifests location will be displayed by the script.
2. Push the image
```bash
POCKER=$(command -v podman || command -v docker) "$@"
$POCKER push <image>
```

3. Apply the manifests:
The generated manifest files (in order of deployment) are:
```
00-secret_aap-db-deploy.yaml
01-configmap_aap-db-deploy-props.yaml
02-configmap_01-aap-db-deploy-resources-schemas.yaml
03-configmap_02-aap-db-deploy-resources-specs.yaml
04-sonataflow_aap-db-deploy.yaml
```

All the previous steps can be done together by running:
```bash
../scripts/build.sh --image=quay.io/orchestrator/demo-advanced --deploy
```

### Configuring Secrets
Before deployment, ensure the correct values are set in [00-secret_aap-db-deploy.yaml](./aap-db-deploy-workflow/manifests/00-secret_aap-db-deploy-secrets.yaml).
You can update the `secret.properties` file before generating the manifests or modify the generated secret file directly.

### Verifying Deployment
Check that the workflow's Custom Resource (CR) and pod are ready:
```bash
oc get sonataflow -n sonataflow-infra aap-db-deploy
NAME                  PROFILE   VERSION   URL   READY   REASON
aap-db-deploy         gitops    1.0             True

oc get pods -n sonataflow-infra -l sonataflow.org/workflow-app=aap-db-deploy
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aap-db-deploy-68ff48fdb6-7wcrc         1/1     Running   0          10m
```

> **_NOTE:_** It is recommended to deploy the workflow in the sonataflow-infra namespace unless another namespace is properly [configured](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/orchestrator-helm-operator/tree/main/docs/release-1.3#additional-workflow-namespaces).

## Setting up AAP (Ansible Automation Platform)
1. Create a job template in AAP using this [Ansible playbook](./postgres_playbook/psql.yaml). This playbook deploys PostgreSQL on the same OCP cluster where RHDH and the Orchestrator are installed.
1. Configure OCP/K8s credentials in AAP for applying manifests. Follow the [Red Hat Developer Guide](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/06/26/how-deploy-apps-k8s-cluster-automation-controller#install_and_configure_ansible_automation_platform) for details. Create a service account (SA) and assign it appropriate permissions:
    ```bash
    oc create sa orchestrator-ocp-api
    oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin -z orchestrator-ocp-api
    ```
1. Create a persistent token secret for the SA:    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
    metadata:
    name: orchestrator-ocp-api-token
    annotations:
        kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "orchestrator-ocp-api"
    ```

---

## Setting up ArgoCD
In order for ArgoCD to be allowed to deployed resources in the target namespace, that namespace must be labeled as below:

```bash
oc label namespace $ARGOCD_NAMESPACE rhdh.redhat.com/argocd-namespace=
```
With `ARGOCD_NAMESPACE` being the target namespace in which ArgoCD must deploy the application.

Target namespace should also be labeled with `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: <argocd-namespace>` (e.g. `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: orchestrator-gitops`).

## Setting up RBAC
Currently, the subflows of a workflow are displayed at the same level as the main workflow in the Orchestrator RHDH UI.

You can hide the subflows using RBAC, see https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/blob/orchestrator-1.6/workspaces/orchestrator/docs/Permissions.md for more information.

## Running the Workflow
Once the workflow's pods are ready, use the RHDH Orchestrator plugin to invoke the workflow.
Monitor the Results pane and notifications for workflow execution progress.

## Running the Demo
Once everything is configured, use the Orchestrator plugin to run the workflow, watch for notifications and the results pane of the workflow's run.

## Cleanup
In order to tear-down the resources created by the demo, the following should be executed:

* Clean K8s resources from the cluster:
```bash
ARGOCD_NAMESPACE=spring-petclinic-dev
oc delete applications.argoproj.io -n openshift-gitops $ARGOCD_NAMESPACE
oc delete svc -n $ARGOCD_NAMESPACE --all
oc delete route -n --all
oc delete deployment -n $ARGOCD_NAMESPACE --all
```

* Remove GitHub repositories:
```bash
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=test-workflows
gh repo list $GITHUB_ORGANIZATION --limit 200 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} gh repo delete {} --yes
```

* Unregister the component from RHDH software catalog.
