# üõ†Ô∏è Build image for workflow image build

This container image built by [Dockerfile](Dockerfile.orchestrator-workflow-builder) provides a CLI-based environment with tools required for:
* Building workflow image
* Generating workflow manifets for k8s
* Pushing image to image registry
* Deploying manifests on k8s/OCP cluster 

## üì¶ Included Tools

| Tool            | Purpose                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `podman`        | Container runtime for building the image         |
| `kubectl`       | Kubernetes CLI                                   |
| `yq`            | YAML processor                                   |
| `jq`            | JSON processor                                   |
| `curl`, `git`, `find`, `which`, `bash`, `bind-utils` | Shell utilities for dev and for debug |
| `kn-workflow`   | CLI for generating Serverless Workflow manifests |

The image includes also a [Dockerfile](../docker/osl.Dockerfile) that is used to build the workflow's image.

## üöÄ How to Build with Podman

To build the container image using [Podman](https://podman.io/), run the following command in the root of the project:

### 1. Set your tag
`TAG` should be bumped accordig to the version of the kn-workflow CLI that is included in the Dockerfile.
It should be compatible with the version of the builder image as specified in [Dockerfile](../docker/osl.Dockerfile).

```bash
IMAGE=quay.io/orchestrator/orchestrator-workflow-builder
TAG=1.35
```

### 2. Build each architecture-specific image and tag it
```bash
IMAGE=quay.io/orchestrator/orchestrator-workflow-builder
TAG=1.35
podman build --platform linux/amd64 -t ${IMAGE}-amd64:${TAG} -f scripts/Dockerfile.orchestrator-workflow-builder .
podman build --platform linux/arm64 -t ${IMAGE}-arm64:${TAG} -f scripts/Dockerfile.orchestrator-workflow-builder .
```

### 3. Push architecture-specific images to Quay
```bash
podman push ${IMAGE}-amd64:${TAG}
podman push ${IMAGE}-arm64:${TAG}
```

### 4. Create and push the manifest list
```bash
podman manifest create ${IMAGE}:${TAG}
podman manifest add ${IMAGE}:${TAG} ${IMAGE}-amd64:${TAG}
podman manifest add ${IMAGE}:${TAG} ${IMAGE}-arm64:${TAG}

# Push the multi-arch manifest to Quay
podman manifest push ${IMAGE}:${TAG} docker://${IMAGE}:${TAG}
```

## Maintaining the Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile.orchestrator-workflow-builder` is a critical component that defines the build environment used for generating, building, and optionally deploying SonataFlow workflow applications. It includes the installation of core dependencies such as `podman`, `kubectl`, and the `kn-workflow` CLI plugin.

### When to Rebuild

Rebuild the Dockerfile-based image in the following scenarios:
- When the [`scripts/build.sh`](scripts/build.sh) script or any of its dependent libraries changes.
- When upgrading or downgrading the `kn-workflow` CLI version to align with a specific Orchestrator release.

### Version Alignment

Ensure the correct version of `kn-workflow` is installed in the image, as compatibility with Orchestrator versions depends on it:

| Orchestrator Version | Required `kn-workflow` Version |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1.4, 1.5             | 1.35                          |
| 1.6                  | 1.36                          |

To upgrade the CLI, modify the relevant `RUN` instruction in the Dockerfile that installs `kn-workflow`, updating the version and URL accordingly.

Always validate the image after rebuilding to ensure the build script functions correctly with the specified `kn-workflow` version.
